# Linear-Regression-Models-for-Iris-Dataset
This repository contains Python code for building and comparing linear regression models using the Iris dataset. Two models are implemented to predict the petal width based on different independent variables (sepal length and petal length). The models are built using the probabilistic programming library PyMC.
